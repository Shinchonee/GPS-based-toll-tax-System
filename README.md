# GPS-based-toll-tax-System
The current toll collection system on national highways, primarily reliant on toll plazas with manual or electronic toll collection, presents inefficiencies that impede traffic flow and revenue collection. These inefficiencies stem from the obligatory stopping of vehicles at toll booths, resulting in congestion and wasted travel time.  Furthermore, the static, per-toll plaza pricing structure fails to account for the nuanced variations in distance travelled by individual vehicles. A GPS-based toll collection system emerges as a potential solution, aiming to leverage technological advancements to rectify these shortcomings. This novel approach proposes the utilization of on-board GPS technology or strategically placed roadside infrastructure to meticulously track a vehicle's movement throughout its journey on the national highway network. By meticulously mapping the traversed distance, the system can then calculate a precise toll charge directly proportional to the distance travelled, ensuring a fair and equitable user-pay principle. This paradigm shift in toll collection has the potential to revolutionize traffic flow, expedite commutes, and optimize revenue generation on national highways.
